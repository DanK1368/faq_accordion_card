## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS with partials
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- Mobile first approach
- Continuing to improve the use of SASS with partials
- Working with the DOM in JS, manipulating elements and inserting classes during click events
- Although I'm not sure if this is the right approach, but since certain elements needed
  to be changed during a click event, while others not, I made use of a filtered array to achieve this.
